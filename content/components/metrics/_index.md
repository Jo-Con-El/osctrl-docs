The metrics component of **osctrl** provides instrumentation for the following operations:

* Receiving requests to osctrl-tls,
* Receiving requests to osctrl-admin,
* Generating errors during normal operations both in osctrl-tls and osctrl-admin.

Note that if the number of enrolled nodes is large enough, these metrics will generate valuable data to assess the performance of **osctrl**.
