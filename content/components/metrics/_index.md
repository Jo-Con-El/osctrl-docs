The metrics component of **osctrl** provides instrumentation for the following operations:

* Received requests to osctrl-tls. If the number of enrolled nodes is large enough, this will generate valuable data to assess the performance of our service.
* Received requests to osctrl-admin.
* Errors generated during normal operations both in osctrl-tls and osctrl-admin.
