# osctrl

## What is **osctrl**?

**osctrl** is a fast and efficient [osquery](https://osquery.io) management solution, implementing its [remote API](https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deployment/remote/) as TLS endpoint.

With **osctrl** you are able to:

* Monitor all your systems running osquery,
* Distribute osquery configuration fast across all your enrolled nodes,
* Collect all the status and result logs, whether you want to store them or forward them to a different system (Splunk, ELK, Kafka, Graylog...),
* Run quasi-real-time on-demand queries in your selected enrolled nodes,
* Carve files or directories from your enrolled nodes.

**osctrl** has been designed to work as a scalable and reliable solution. It has been used successfully in networks from hundreds to hundreds of thousands nodes.
